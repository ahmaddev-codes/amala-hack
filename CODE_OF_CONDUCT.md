# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in a manner that makes participation a positive
experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community
include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any nature
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective measures to
address any behavior that violates our standards.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you have experienced or observed unacceptable behavior, please report it right
away to the community leaders listed below. All reports will be reviewed and
investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter. All reports will be handled in a discreet manner. Any member of the
community who is the subject of a report will not be notified directly that a
report has been filed against them. The only exception to this rule is if the
report involves a threat to the safety or well-being of a community member.

## Contact Information

If you need to report an incident, please contact the community leaders at:

- Email: [contact@amala-hack.com](mailto:contact@amala-hack.com)

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may result in
temporary or permanent bans from the community. No one is exempt from this policy.
Community leaders will take appropriate action to address such behavior, which
may include warnings, temporary bans, or permanent bans from the community.
